# Kotlin Multiplatform Application

## Overview

This repository contains a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) application that demonstrates the power and flexibility of writing shared code across multiple platforms. With Kotlin Multiplatform, developers can write common business logic once and use it across Android, iOS, and other platforms, reducing code duplication and accelerating development.

## Features

- **Shared Codebase:** The application features a shared codebase written in Kotlin that contains common business logic, data models, and utility functions. This shared code is used across Android and iOS platforms, ensuring consistency and minimizing redundancy.

- **Platform-Specific UI:** While the core logic is shared, platform-specific user interfaces are implemented using platform-specific frameworks such as Jetpack Compose for Android and SwiftUI for iOS. This allows for native look and feel on each platform while leveraging shared business logic.

- **Network Communication:** The application demonstrates network communication capabilities by fetching data from a remote API using shared networking code. The same networking logic is used on both Android and iOS platforms, enabling seamless data retrieval and synchronization.

- **Unit Testing:** Unit tests are included to ensure the reliability and correctness of the shared codebase. Using Kotlin Multiplatform, unit tests can be written once and run on both Android and iOS platforms, simplifying the testing process and improving code quality.

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.
3. Build and run the Android application using Android Studio or the command line.
4. Build and run the iOS application using Xcode or the command line.
5. Explore the shared codebase and platform-specific implementations to understand how Kotlin Multiplatform works.
